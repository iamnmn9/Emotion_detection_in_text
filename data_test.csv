anger,I got angry at a friend of mine whom I caught reading my notebook (almanach).
sadness,"My sweetheart left me, or rather we decided to break it off by mutual consent.  The consequences were - unrestrained weeping, feelings of loneliness, hopelessness and disconsolation.  I felt that I should find a friend, to talk to joyfully and to forget."
sadness,"Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . "
neutral, It sure is . 
sadness,He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . 
anger,When stupid people push me during rush time in the city.
